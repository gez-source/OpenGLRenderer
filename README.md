# OpenGLRenderer
OpenGL Renderer with realtime dynamic lighting

This is an incomplete proof of concept of an OpenGL shader software renderer.

1. Some code is based on Tiny Renderer by Dmitry V. Sokolov some remnants of the code like the OBJ model loader are still within, looking at moving away and using my own model loader and 3D models. https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer
2. Collada DAE Parser is ported from Java to C++ and is based on public domain work here: https://github.com/TheThinMatrix/OpenGL-Animation
